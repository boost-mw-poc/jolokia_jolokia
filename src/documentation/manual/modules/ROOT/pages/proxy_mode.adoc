= Proxy Mode

Using Jolokia in proxy mode enables for agentless operation
on the target server. A dedicated agent deployment proxies by
accepting Jolokia requests as input, translating them to JSR-160
requests for the target. This setup is described in
xref:architecture.adoc#proxy-mode[Proxy Mode]. As noted there, the real target is
given within the original request, which must be sent as a POST
request.

Agents of all types support the proxy mode. However, since one
has usually the free choice of platform for a dedicated Jolokia
proxy, an environment optimized for HTTP communication should be
used. These are either servlet container or Jakarta EE server hosting
the WAR agent or an OSGi runtime with an https://docs.osgi.org/specification/osgi.cmpn/8.1.0/service.servlet.html[OSGi CMPN Whiteboard extender,role=externalLink,window=_blank] (which
in turn is typically based on an embedded servlet container like
Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow).

In Jolokia 1.x, proxy mode is turned on or off depending on `dispatcherClasses` option. If it contains `org.jolokia.jsr160.Jsr160RequestDispatcher`, proxy mode will be enabled, because this special dispatcher will be used.

In Jolokia 2, `org.jolokia.service.jsr160.Jsr160RequestHandler` is detected as Jolokia service, so it's a matter of having `jolokia-service-jsr160.jar` on the CLASSPATH.

`jolokia-agent-war.war` includes `WEB-INF/lib/jolokia-service-jsr160.jar`, so proxy mode is enabled. If you want to remove
proxy support, you have to repackage `jolokia-agent-war.war` without this library.

Additionally you can configured a white list with patterns for all allowed JMX service URL in a Jolokia Request.
This white list is a plain text file which contains
https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/regex/Pattern.html[RegExp patterns,role=externalLink,window=_blank] line by line. Lines starting with `#` are ignored.
Pattern matching is performed case insensitive. This file can be configured in various ways:

* Repackaging the `jolokia-agent-war.war` and adapt `web.xml` to
include the init option `jsr160ProxyAllowedTargets` with a file path to the white list. This should
be an absolute path or a relative path if you know where your Jakarta EE server sets the current directory.
* Set the system property `jolokia.jsr160ProxyAllowedTargets` to the path of the whitelist
* Set the environment variable `JOLOKIA_JSR160_PROXY_ALLOWED_TARGETS` to the path of the
whitelist.

By default the following patterns are disallowed, but you can re-enable them when providing them in the whitelist:

----
# Disallow all JNDI lookups via LDAP
service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/ldap:.*
----

In any case it is highly recommended to use a dedicated Jakarta EE servlet server for the JSR-160 proxy which
is secured by configuring the server authentication properly for this servlet. An unprotected Jolokia proxy can be
tricked to execute local code by a malicious attacker. As said previously, the Jolokia proxy should be avoided if
possible in favor of direct access over the Jolokia protocol.

All client libraries (jmx4perl, Java and JavaScript) support the
usage of proxy mode in its API.

[#proxy-limitations
== Limitations of proxy mode

The proxy mode has some limitations compared to the direct
agent mode, so it is recommended to use a
direct agent deployment if possible. The limitations are:

* There is no automatic merging of JMX MBeanServers as in the case
of the direct mode. Most application servers uses their own
MBeanServer in addition to the
`PlatformMBeanServer` (which is always
present). Each MBean is registered only in one MBeanServer. The
choice of which `MBeanServer` to use has to be
given up front, usually as a part of the JMX Service URL. But even
then (as it is the case for JBoss 5.1) you might run into problems
when selecting the proper MBeanServer.
* Proxying adds an additional remote layer which causes
additional problems. I.e. the complex operations like
`list` might fail in the proxy mode
because of serialization issues. E.g. for JBoss it happens
that certain MBeanInfo objects requested for the list
operation are not serializable. This is a bug of JBoss, but
I expect similar limitations for other application servers
as well.
* Certain workarounds (like the JBoss "_can not find
MXBeans before MBeanInfo has been fetched_" bug)
works only in agent mode.
* It is astonishingly hard to set up an application server for
JSR-160 export. And there are even cases (combinations of
JDK and AppServer Version) which don't work at all properly
(e.g. JDK 1.5 and JBoss 5).
* For MBeans that have arguments of type `Map` or `List`
it is required that `org.json.JSONObject` and `org.json.JSONArray`
(contained in `json.jar`) are available on the
classpath of the target JVM that receives the JSR-160 requests.
* The proxy mode can theoretically be exploited for local code execution if not secured properly.
So its is highly recommended to not make the agent available without any authentication to any
non trusted environment. Also the new whitelist feature prevents redirecting to arbitrary JMX Service URLs.
