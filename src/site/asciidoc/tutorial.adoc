== 5 Minute Quickstart

In this tutorial, it will be demonstrated how easily a WAR agent
can be installed on a fresh Tomcat, how to verify the
installation and how to access the client.

=== Preparation

In order to start on a green field, we are installing a
fresh Tomcat in which the agent-war is going to be
installed. Download Tomcat 7 from its
https://tomcat.apache.org/download-70.cgi[site,role=externalLink] and
extract it:

[source,bash]
----
$ tar zxvf apache-tomcat-7.*.tar.gz
$ cd apache-tomcat-7.*
$ TC=`pwd`
----

Download the Jolokia WAR-agent and copy it into Tomcat's
webapp directory:

[source,bash]
----
$ cd $TC/webapps
$ wget \
    https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/jolokia/jolokia-war/1.2.3/jolokia-war-1.2.3.war
$ mv jolokia-war-1.2.3.war jolokia.war
----

=== Startup and Verification

Now the container can be started with:

[source,bash]
----
$ $TC/bin/catalina.sh start
----

In order to verify the installation, point your browser to https://localhost:8080/jolokia/version which should show up something like

=== A simple Java Client

Let's try out the client side of Jolokia. This example will
print out the memory usage of your tomcat:

[source,java]
----
import org.jolokia.client.*;
import org.jolokia.client.request.*;
import java.util.Map;

public class JolokiaDemo {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        J4pClient j4pClient = new J4pClient("https://localhost:8080/jolokia");
        J4pReadRequest req = new J4pReadRequest("java.lang:type=Memory", "HeapMemoryUsage");
        J4pReadResponse resp = j4pClient.execute(req);
        Map<String,Long> vals = resp.getValue();
        long used = vals.get("used");
        long max = vals.get("max");
        int usage = (int) (used * 100 / max);
        System.out.println("Memory usage: used: " + used +
                " / max: " + max + " = " + usage + "%");
    }
}
----

Save this code-snippet under `JolokiaDemo.java`. Then download

* https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/jolokia/jolokia-client-java/1.2.3/jolokia-client-java-1.2.3.jar[jolokia-client-java-1.2.3.jar,role=externalLink]
* https://mirrors.ibiblio.org/pub/mirrors/maven2/com/googlecode/json-simple/json-simple/1.1.1/json-simple-1.1.1.jar[json-simple,role=externalLink]
* https://mirrors.ibiblio.org/pub/mirrors/maven2/org/apache/httpcomponents/httpclient-osgi/4.3.3/httpclient-osgi-4.3.3.jar[httpclient-osgi-4.3.3.jar,role=externalLink]
* https://mirrors.ibiblio.org/pub/mirrors/maven2/org/apache/httpcomponents/httpcore/4.3.3/httpcore-4.3.3.jar[httpcore-4.3.3.jar,role=externalLink]
* https://mirrors.ibiblio.org/pub/mirrors/maven2/commons-logging/commons-logging/1.1.1/commons-logging-1.1.1.jar[commons-logging-1.1.1.jar,role=externalLink]

and put it into the same directory as this demo
class. Finally, compile the demo and let it run:

[source,bash]
----
$ export CLASSPATH=json-simple-1.1.1.jar:jolokia-client-java-1.2.3.jar:\
    httpcore-4.3.3.jar:httpclient-osgi-4.3.3.jar:commons-logging-1.1.1.jar:.

$ javac JolokiaDemo.java
$ java JolokiaDemo
Memory usage: used: 9526648 / max: 129957888 = 7%
----

If you are using Maven, please don't worry about the
dependencies which just have been downloaded manually for the
sake of demonstration. Jolokia's Java client library comes
with a well defined dependency set, so Maven will do the
magic. (In fact, the client library only depends on
jsons-simple and http-components directly)

=== Install Jmx4Perl

The five minutes are probably over now, but I highly
recommend to install
https://www.jmx4perl.org[jmx4perl,role=externalLink] right
now. Beside providing a Perl language binding for Jolokia,
there are some cool command line tools included which are
useful on their own.

* *jmx4perl* is a command for exploring the
JMX space by providing arguments on the command line.
* *j4psh* is a readline based, colored,
interactive shell with context sensitive command
completion on MBean names and attributes/operations. It
is a perfect tool for interactively exploring MBeans and
their values.
* *check_jmx4perl* is a feature-rich Nagios
plugin for connecting the Jolokia agent with Nagios.
* *jolokia* is a supporting script for easy
download and configuration of the Jolokia agents.

`jmx4perl` (and its dependencies) can be easily
installed with `cpan` if you have Perl installed:

[source,bash]
----
$ perl -MCPAN -e shell
Terminal does not support AddHistory.

cpan shell -- CPAN exploration and modules installation (v1.9205)
ReadLine support available (maybe install Bundle::CPAN or Bundle::CPANxxl?)

cpan[1]> install JMX::Jmx4Perl
...
...
jmx4perl
========

jmx4perl is a command line utility for accessing Jolokia agents
(www.jolokia.org). It can be used for script based exploration
and easy inspection of the JMX space.

Install 'jmx4perl' ? (y/n) [y ]
....
----

You will be asked for each featured script whether it should
be installed in addition to the core Perl modules. Each of
these scripts (jmx4perl, j4psh, jolokia, check_jmx4perl) will
introduce a set of new depedencies of Perl modules which in
turn might depend on other Perl modules or system
libraries. Perl modules are resolved and installed
automatically. The agent management script
`jolokia` depends on `XML::LibXML`
which requires a development version of `libxml`
installed locally. It is recommended to install
`libxml2-dev` with the package management tool of
your OS (e.g. `apt-get install libxml2-dev`
). Alternatively, the OS package for XML::LibXML could be
used. (e.g. `libxml-libxml-perl` for
Ubuntu)

When jmx4perl is installed, try out jmx4perl:

[source,bash]
----
$ jmx4perl https://localhost:8080/jolokia list
....
$ jmx4perl https://localhost:8080/jolokia \
    read java.lang:type=Memory HeapMemoryUsage
$ jmx4perl --help
$ man jmx4perl
----

Next, I recommend to try out `j4psh`.  For
getting the best readline experience, it is recommended to
also install `Term::ReadLine::Gnu` (which in turn
requires the package `libreadline-dev` to be
installed), but this is optional. Now, fire up j4psh and let
the fun begin:

Don't forget to try out TAB triggered command and argument
completion as demonstrated in this
https://vimeo.com/20215477[screencast,role=externalLink].

=== Summary

That's all for now, I hope you enjoyed this first ride. For
the next steps I recommend to have a look into
